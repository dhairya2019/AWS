Install Node.js from its official website and create a directory and open **cmd** in that directory

Use **npm –v** command to check the **npm** version

Use **npm init** commnad to create **package.json** file

After creating **package.json** file download **express,nodemon** and jade **dependecy** using **npm**** install **_** package\_name**_ command

For Application Code refer to Github [https://github.com/dhairya2019](https://github.com/dhairya2019) in the express-website repository
